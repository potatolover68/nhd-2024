                    But our findings do not necessarily suggest that the world
                    should entirely abandon the Laws of War and related
                    international norms. Rather, such agreements may need better
                    sanctioning mechanisms. The individual risk of being a
                    victim of political violence more generally has decreased
                    significantly in recent decadesâ€¦More proactive ICRC
                    policymaking and an International Humanitarian Law with
                    teeth could reduce civilian suffering.
