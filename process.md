# How did you choose your topic and how does it relate to the annual theme?

We first were planning to discuss the Declaration of Geneva (completely unrelated to the Geneva Conventions), a medical ethics guideline that stated the responsibilities of a doctor. We could not, however, find any rights directly linked to it, so we decided to switch to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions is related to the annual theme "Rights and Responsibilities" because the Geneva Conventions are a set of documents that list the rights and responsibilities of medical personnel, civilians, and belligerents in war.

# How did you conduct your research?

We first gathered sources about each of the conventions, the additional protocols, and a few court cases. After that, we found all of our images. Finally, we found our counter argument source. We researched by just googling.

# How did you create your project?

This was my first _"large"_ React Project(I mostly just used pure HTML before), so this was as much of a learning experience for me as for the viewers.

`yarn create react-app` + `react-router` make for a pretty good static site, especially when paired with typescript and yarn.

## Why React?

When writing modular, content-oriented websites(like a NHD website) it's really convenient to have components that can support all sorts of content. This incudes images, text and video.

## Why don't you just use the website builder?

There are just too many limitations, and to really make a website that _pops_ I think making the site from scratch is worth the effort. I also took this as a learning opportunity.

1. I originally started the site as just another static site, but after considering for a bit, I decided that it was not very practical to copy-and-paste `<div>` tags for 10 hours so I converted it to a react site.
   1. To convert the website, I first used `yarn init react-app` to generate the template.
   2. I first copy-and-pasted each component into its own file, then I moved all the styles to their respective components.
2. After receiving feedback that the site is not very visually appealing, I reworked it to look more professional.
3. I moved the content into the site via manual copy-pasting.

# In what ways is your topic significant in history?

The First Geneva Convention revolutionized wartime medical care and was the first widespread humanitarian agreement. The conventions were a major part of the international humanitarian response to atrocities such as the Holocaust and devastating wars such as World War 1, which caused the 1929 Geneva Convention. The First Geneva Convention set the groundwork for international humanitarian law. It also provided a framework for the development of medical services in warzones. The conventions created rules battling brutalism in war and created a standard for the protection of civilians.
