# How did you choose your topic and how does it relate to the annual theme?

We first were planning to discuss the Declaration of Geneva(completely unrelated to the Geneva Conventions), a medical ethics guideline that stated the responsibilities of a doctor. We could not, however, find any rights directly linked to it, so we decided to switch to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions is related to the annual theme "Rights and Responsibilities" because he Geneva Conventions are a set of documents that list the rights of medical personnel and civilians in war, and the responsibilities of belligerents.

# How did you conduct your research?

We first gathered a list of sources and looked for images, videos, and other media that could help us understand the topic. We also used sites such as Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, and more to find sources to support our argument.

# How did you create your project?

This was my first _"large"_ React Project(I mostly just used pure HTML before), so this was as much of a learning experience for me as for the viewers.

`yarn create react-app` + `react-router` make for a pretty good static site, especially when paired with typescript and yarn.

## Why React?

When writing modular, content-oriented websites(like a NHD website) it's really convenient to have components that can support all sorts of content. This incudes images, text and video.

## Why Yarn?

Why not?

## Why don't you just use the website builder?

There are just too many limitations, and to really make a website that _pops_ I think making the site from scratch is worth the effort. I also took this as a learning opportunity.

1. I originally started the site as just another static site, but after considering for a bit, I decided that it was boneheaded to copy-and-paste `<div>` tags for 10 hours so I converted it to a react site.
   1. To convert the website, I first used `yarn init react-app` to generate the template.
   2. I first copy-and-pasted each component into its own file, then I moved all the styles to their respective components.
2. After receiving feedback that "the site is slightly ugly" I reworked it to look more professional.
3. I moved the content into the site via manual copy-pasting.

# What is your historical argument?

The Geneva Conventions set the groundwork for international humanitarian law, saving millions of civilians and helping innumerable soldiers during wartime. It also provided a framework for the development of medical and humanitarian services. It created rules battling brutalism in war and create a standard for the protection of civilians.

# In what ways is your topic significant in history?

The Geneva Conventions revolutionized wartime medical care and had a major effect on almost all conflicts following its introduction, including both world wars and conflicts in the Middle East. The conventions were a major part of the international humanitarian response to the Holocaust and the Holocaust denial movement.
