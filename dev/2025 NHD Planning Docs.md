BACKGROUND:  
You need to describe what happened in the absence of these protections during the battle. Why did Dunant feel a need to enact change? How was an “appeal to humanity” violated? (Article by article)

On what basis did Dunant justify his protections? (Legislative / Political) Look up what philosophy influenced him to think in this new way.

Background

“In 1859, Genevan businessman Henry Dunant traveled to Emperor Napoleon III’s headquarters in northern Italy to seek land rights for a business venture.”

On his journey, he witnessed the battlefield of the Battle of Solferino where nearly 40,000 perished. Even though by the time he arrived the fight had concluded, he was still horrified by the suffering.

“The horrific suffering Dunant saw impacted him so greatly he wrote a first-hand account in 1862 called _A Memory of Solferino_. But he didn’t just write about what he’d observed, he also proposed a solution: All nations come together to create trained, volunteer relief groups to treat battlefield wounded and offer humanitarian assistance to those affected by war.”

He also helped by organizing medical aid for the wounded and forming the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded, now known as the Red Cross, in 1863\. All of these actions inspired 16 countries to send delegates and military medical units to Geneva for negotiations about a treaty to reduce wartime suffering.

“The conference…lasted from 8-22 August 1864.”

This meeting and the treaty signed by 12 nations at the end were known as the First Geneva Convention.

“This convention provided for (1) the immunity from capture and destruction of all establishments for the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers and their personnel, (2) the impartial reception and treatment of all combatants, (3) the protection of civilians providing aid to the wounded, and (4) the recognition of the Red Cross symbol as a means of identifying persons and equipment covered by the agreement.”

Despite his contributions, Henry Dunant spent most of the rest of his life in poverty as he neglected his business affairs. He continued to raise awareness about humanitarian issues.

Theme-Topic Connection

The First Geneva Convention created rights and gave responsibilities for the purpose of decreasing suffering during conflicts.

“Article 1\. Ambulances and military hospitals shall be recognized as neutral, and as such, protected and respected by the belligerents as long as they accommodate wounded and sick.

Neutrality shall end if the said ambulances or hospitals should be held by a military force.”

This article gives medical units the right to protection and respect while also burdening them with the responsibility of assisting those in bad condition and soldiers with the responsibility of refraining from engaging with aid providers.

“Art. 2\. Hospital and ambulance personnel, including the quarter-master's staff, the medical, administrative and transport services, and the chaplains, shall have the benefit of the same neutrality when on duty, and while there remain any wounded to be brought in or assisted.”

Article 2 further clarifies the right of protection for medical personnel and the responsibility of combatants to uphold this right.

“Art. 3\. The persons designated in the preceding Article may, even after enemy occupation, continue to discharge their functions in the hospital or ambulance with which they serve, or may withdraw to rejoin the units to which they belong.

When in these circumstances they cease from their functions, such persons shall be delivered to the enemy outposts by the occupying forces.”

This gives medical units the right to choose to either remain and provide aid even after enemy occupation or leave to the country they belong to. However, they have the responsibility to continue performing their job. The enemy has the responsibility of leaving these personnel alone.

“Art. 4\. The material of military hospitals being subject to the laws of war, the persons attached to such hospitals may take with them, on withdrawing, only the articles which are their own personal property.

Ambulances, on the contrary, under similar circumstances, shall retain their equipment.”

Occupiers of military hospitals have the responsibility to allow supplies to remain when withdrawing. On the other hand, ambulances have the right to keep their equipment.

“Art. 5\. Inhabitants of the country who bring help to the wounded shall be respected and shall remain free. Generals of the belligerent Powers shall make it their duty to notify the inhabitants of the appeal made to their humanity, and of the neutrality which humane conduct will confer.

The presence of any wounded combatant receiving shelter and care in a house shall ensure its protection. An inhabitant who has given shelter to the wounded shall be exempted from billeting and from a portion of such war contributions as may be levied.”

People who treat the wounded have the right to protection of themselves and their home and exemption from billeting. Combatants have the responsibility to obey this right.

“Art. 6\. Wounded or sick combatants, to whatever nation they may belong, shall be collected and cared for.

Commanders-in-Chief may hand over immediately to the enemy outposts enemy combatants wounded during an engagement, when circumstances allow and subject to the agreement of both parties.

Those who, after their recovery, are recognized as being unfit for further service, shall be repatriated.

The others may likewise be sent back, on condition that they shall not again, for the duration of hostilities, take up arms.

Evacuation parties, and the personnel conducting them, shall be considered as being absolutely neutral.”

All injured soldiers have the right to care. If after treatment, one cannot continue fighting, they have the right to be sent back to their country. Evacuation organizers and those evacuating have the right to protection. Those who participate in war have the responsibility of obeying these rights.

“Art. 7\. A distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted for hospitals, ambulances and evacuation parties. It should in all circumstances be accompanied by the national flag.

An armlet may also be worn by personnel enjoying neutrality but its issue shall be left to the military authorities.

Both flag and armlet shall bear a red cross on a white ground.”

This article gives hospitals, ambulances, and evacuation parties the responsibility to use an identification flag, a national one, and the red cross symbol.

“Art. 8\. The implementing of the present Convention shall be arranged by the Commanders-in-Chief of the belligerent armies following the instructions of their respective Governments and in accordance with the general principles set forth in this Convention.”

This text makes Commanders-in-Chief responsible for implementing the articles in a way which obeys it and their government.

Both articles 9 and 10 are not related to the theme.
