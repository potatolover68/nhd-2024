BACKGROUND:  
You need to describe what happened in the absence of these protections during the battle. Why did Dunant feel a need to enact change? How was an “appeal to humanity” violated? (Article by article)

On what basis did Dunant justify his protections? (Legislative / Political) Look up what philosophy influenced him to think in this new way.

Background

“In 1859, Genevan businessman Henry Dunant traveled to Emperor Napoleon III’s headquarters in northern Italy to seek land rights for a business venture.”

On his journey, he witnessed the battlefield of the Battle of Solferino where nearly 40,000 perished. Even though by the time he arrived the fight had concluded, he was still horrified by the suffering.

“The horrific suffering Dunant saw impacted him so greatly he wrote a first-hand account in 1862 called _A Memory of Solferino_. But he didn’t just write about what he’d observed, he also proposed a solution: All nations come together to create trained, volunteer relief groups to treat battlefield wounded and offer humanitarian assistance to those affected by war.”

He also helped by organizing medical aid for the wounded and forming the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded, now known as the Red Cross, in 1863\. All of these actions inspired 16 countries to send delegates and military medical units to Geneva for negotiations about a treaty to reduce wartime suffering.

“The conference…lasted from 8-22 August 1864.”

This meeting and the treaty signed by 12 nations at the end were known as the First Geneva Convention.

“This convention provided for (1) the immunity from capture and destruction of all establishments for the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers and their personnel, (2) the impartial reception and treatment of all combatants, (3) the protection of civilians providing aid to the wounded, and (4) the recognition of the Red Cross symbol as a means of identifying persons and equipment covered by the agreement.”

Despite his contributions, Henry Dunant spent most of the rest of his life in poverty as he neglected his business affairs. He continued to raise awareness about humanitarian issues.

Theme-Topic Connection

The First Geneva Convention created rights and gave responsibilities for the purpose of decreasing suffering during conflicts.

“Article 1\. Ambulances and military hospitals shall be recognized as neutral, and as such, protected and respected by the belligerents as long as they accommodate wounded and sick.

Neutrality shall end if the said ambulances or hospitals should be held by a military force.”

This article gives medical units the right to protection and respect while also burdening them with the responsibility of assisting those in bad condition and soldiers with the responsibility of refraining from engaging with aid providers.

“Art. 2\. Hospital and ambulance personnel, including the quarter-master's staff, the medical, administrative and transport services, and the chaplains, shall have the benefit of the same neutrality when on duty, and while there remain any wounded to be brought in or assisted.”

Article 2 further clarifies the right of protection for medical personnel and the responsibility of combatants to uphold this right.

“Art. 3\. The persons designated in the preceding Article may, even after enemy occupation, continue to discharge their functions in the hospital or ambulance with which they serve, or may withdraw to rejoin the units to which they belong.

When in these circumstances they cease from their functions, such persons shall be delivered to the enemy outposts by the occupying forces.”

This gives medical units the right to choose to either remain and provide aid even after enemy occupation or leave to the country they belong to. However, they have the responsibility to continue performing their job. The enemy has the responsibility of leaving these personnel alone.

“Art. 4\. The material of military hospitals being subject to the laws of war, the persons attached to such hospitals may take with them, on withdrawing, only the articles which are their own personal property.

Ambulances, on the contrary, under similar circumstances, shall retain their equipment.”

Occupiers of military hospitals have the responsibility to allow supplies to remain when withdrawing. On the other hand, ambulances have the right to keep their equipment.

“Art. 5\. Inhabitants of the country who bring help to the wounded shall be respected and shall remain free. Generals of the belligerent Powers shall make it their duty to notify the inhabitants of the appeal made to their humanity, and of the neutrality which humane conduct will confer.

The presence of any wounded combatant receiving shelter and care in a house shall ensure its protection. An inhabitant who has given shelter to the wounded shall be exempted from billeting and from a portion of such war contributions as may be levied.”

People who treat the wounded have the right to protection of themselves and their home and exemption from billeting. Combatants have the responsibility to obey this right.

“Art. 6\. Wounded or sick combatants, to whatever nation they may belong, shall be collected and cared for.

Commanders-in-Chief may hand over immediately to the enemy outposts enemy combatants wounded during an engagement, when circumstances allow and subject to the agreement of both parties.

Those who, after their recovery, are recognized as being unfit for further service, shall be repatriated.

The others may likewise be sent back, on condition that they shall not again, for the duration of hostilities, take up arms.

Evacuation parties, and the personnel conducting them, shall be considered as being absolutely neutral.”

All injured soldiers have the right to care. If after treatment, one cannot continue fighting, they have the right to be sent back to their country. Evacuation organizers and those evacuating have the right to protection. Those who participate in war have the responsibility of obeying these rights.

“Art. 7\. A distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted for hospitals, ambulances and evacuation parties. It should in all circumstances be accompanied by the national flag.

An armlet may also be worn by personnel enjoying neutrality but its issue shall be left to the military authorities.

Both flag and armlet shall bear a red cross on a white ground.”

This article gives hospitals, ambulances, and evacuation parties the responsibility to use an identification flag, a national one, and the red cross symbol.

“Art. 8\. The implementing of the present Convention shall be arranged by the Commanders-in-Chief of the belligerent armies following the instructions of their respective Governments and in accordance with the general principles set forth in this Convention.”

This text makes Commanders-in-Chief responsible for implementing the articles in a way which obeys it and their government.

Both articles 9 and 10 are not related to the theme.

Effects

Long-Term Effects

The First Geneva Convention was not the only one. There were 3 other conventions and 3 additional protocols, each of which were based on previous ones and therefore were effects of the earliest one.

Proposals to revise the Convention of 1864 led to the 1899 Hague Peace Conference, which contained a wish for another conference about the revision. This was organized by the Swiss government and took place in 1906\. 35 parties attended, and a new document was agreed to.

“With 33 articles divided into eight chapters, the Convention of 1906 is more detailed and more precise in its terminology than the Convention of 1864\. New provisions were included concerning the burial of the dead and the transmission of information. The voluntary aid societies were for the first time expressly recognized. On the other hand, provisions which had proved to be impracticable were changed. The prerogatives of the inhabitants bringing help to the wounded were reduced to more reasonable proportions, and the duty to repatriate the wounded who are unfit for further service was transformed into a mere recommendation.”

“Art. 3\. After every engagement the belligerent who remains in possession of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and to protect the wounded and dead from robbery and ill treatment.

He will see that a careful examination is made of the bodies of the dead prior to their interment or incineration.”

This article is related to the theme as it gives the right of protection to the wounded and dead. It also grants bodies the right to careful examination. Militaries are given the responsibility to uphold these rights and search for those injured.

“After World War I, it was clear the 1906 Convention and The Hague Convention of 1907 didn’t go far enough. In 1929, updates were made to further the civilized treatment of prisoners of war.”

“The most important innovations consisted in the prohibition of reprisals and collective penalties, the organization of prisoners'work, the designation, by the prisoners, of representatives and the control exercised by protecting Powers.”

“Art. 2\. Prisoners of war are in the power of the hostile Government, but not of the individuals or formation which captured them.

They shall at all times be humanely treated and protected, particularly against acts of violence, from insults and from public curiosity.

Measures of reprisal against them are forbidden.”

This article gives prisoners of war the right to humane treatment, protection, and avoiding reprisal. Governments are responsible for obeying these rights.

“The Geneva Conventions which were adopted before 1949 were concerned with combatants only, not with civilians…The events of World War II showed the disastrous consequences of the absence of a convention for the protection of civilians in wartime. The Convention adopted in 1949 takes account of the experiences of World War II.”

A major detail about the document was that one of its focuses was on civilian rights and responsibilities.

“Article 5…Where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as a spy or saboteur…such person shall…be regarded as having forfeited rights of communication under the present Convention.”

This article removes rights of communication for spies and saboteurs. This action also removes the responsibility to follow these rights.

“In the decades following World War II, the large number of anticolonial and insurrectionary wars threatened to render the Geneva Conventions obsolete. After four years of Red Cross-sponsored negotiations, two additional protocols to the 1949 conventions, covering both combatants and civilians, were approved in 1977.”

This document expanded what was considered an international conflict as most previous conferences only considered these types of wars despite that most fighting at that time was not in this category. It also allowed for the creation of fact-finding committees to investigate possible violations of the conventions.

“Article 10…All the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, to whichever Party they belong, shall be respected and protected.”

This article gives the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked the right to respect and protection. It burdens military units with the responsibility to uphold these rights.

“The only provision applicable to non-international armed conflicts before the adoption of the present Protocol was Article 3 common to all four Geneva Conventions of 1949\. This Article proved to be inadequate in view of the fact that about 80% of the victims of armed conflicts since 1945 have been victims of non-international conflicts and that non-international conflicts are often fought with more cruelty than international conflicts.”

The purpose of this protocol was to apply the rules of international wars to internal battles. Important contents include a ban on the order for no survivors and six articles contributing towards the protection of civilians.

“Article 7…All the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, whether or not they have taken part in the armed conflict, shall be respected and protected.”

This article grants certain individuals the right to respect and protection. The responsibility to obey these rights goes to belligerents.

“Since the nineteenth century the red cross and red crescent emblems have been used as universal symbols of assistance for armed conflict victims…the emblems are sometimes perceived in particular contexts as having a religious or political connotation…As a consequence, the emblems are not given the respect they are due, which diminishes the protection afforded those displaying them.”

To solve this, a third protocol was added during a conference which lasted from December 5 to 8 in 2005\. It created a new emblem meant to be empty of any connotations. This symbol, the red crystal, was a square tilted on its corner on top of a white background.

Ended review

“Article 4…The International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and their duly authorized personnel, may use, in exceptional circumstances and to facilitate their work, the distinctive emblem referred to in Article 2 of this Protocol.”

This article grants aid workers the right to use the red crystal emblem and responsibility to only utilize it in the correct circumstances.

When the rights and responsibilities of the Geneva Conventions were broken, the violators were prosecuted.

“Tihomir Blaškić, initially a colonel in the HVO who was later appointed Commander of the HVO, stood trial for allegedly having individually planned, instigated, ordered or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of the use of Bosnian Muslims as human shields and for the mistreatment of Bosnian Muslims in HVO detention facilities, including physical and psychological abuse, inhuman treatment and intimidation, as well as for failing to investigate and punish subordinates responsible for detention related crimes. The prosecution accused Blaškić…of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for willful killing, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to the body or health, extensive destruction of property, inhuman treatment, and taking civilians as hostages…”

He was convicted of all these crimes and sentenced to 45 years, but the Appeals Chamber removed many convictions, not including the breakage of the Geneva Conventions through inhuman treatment. The punishment decreased to 9 years.

“The defendant was the burgomaster of a municipality in Rwanda in 1994\. He was charged, in the context of the Rwandan genocide, with exhorting the population to kill Tutsies and moderate Hutus and with inciting refugees to go back to their homes, with the intention of having them killed and taking their property…He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Military Court of Appeal partially upheld the judgment, reducing the sentence to 14 years' imprisonment. It found that the defendant was guilty under…Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Article 4 of Additional Protocol II of 1977…”

Short Term Effects

The Geneva Conventions protected future wartime individuals through creating rights and distributing responsibilities.

“Article 1\. Ambulances and military hospitals shall be recognized as neutral, and as such, protected and respected by the belligerents as long as they accommodate wounded and sick.”

This article protects medical units and forces them to accommodate and protect the injured.

“Art. 6\. Mobile sanitary formations (i.e., those which are intended to accompany armies in the field) and the fixed establishments belonging to the sanitary service shall be protected and respected by belligerents.”

This protects sanitary organizations, which protect civilians and soldiers.

“Art. 4\. The detaining Power is required to provide for the maintenance of prisoners of war in its charge.”

This document protects prisoners of war.

“Article 3…Persons taking no active part in the hostilities…shall in all circumstances be treated humanely…”

Protection is given to those not in combat.

“Article 17…The civilian population shall respect the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, even if they belong to the adverse Party, and shall commit no act of violence against them.”

This article shields the wounded from civilian attacks.

“Article 13…The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited…Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Part, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”

Article 13 protects civilians while also ensuring belligerents are not injured by the civilian population.

“Article 2…This Protocol recognizes an additional distinctive emblem in addition to, and for the same purposes as, the distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions. The distinctive emblems shall enjoy equal status.”

This text protects users of emblems such as medical personnel by creating a new one without connotations decreasing effectiveness.
